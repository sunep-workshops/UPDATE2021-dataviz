# Data Driven AudioVisuals
A workshop where we examine how we can use arbitrary data for artistic purposes..
## Description
In October 2018 I was diagnosedwith *Acute Lymphatic Leukemia (B-ALL)*.

This resulted in a more than 2 year long treatment with daily chemotherapy most of the time. Determined to not let all this suffering have no creative outcome, I needed to find a way to use this for something good so it was not all suffering and nausea.
I am now cured, but more tests are being taken at lower frequency for some years to come to monitor me.

In Denmark everyone have access to all their own data collected in the health care system. While seeing these data, it did not take long for an idea of using this data to drive the narrative of an AV-installation/film to manifest itself.

In this workshop we will explore the possibilities of using data do create dynamic audiovisuals.
We will use either the blood data I provide or other data that the participants find interesting.

This workshop is not a "traditional" datavisualization workshop. In my work I use data as basis for abstract artistic expression.

The work will be based on [vvvv-beta](https://vvvv.org/). Prior experience with vvvv will be nice but is not necessary.

This workshop will also be an instroduction to vvvv_beta.

## What will you learn?
- Basic skills in vvvv
- How to use data from various data sources to create visuals and sound
## Requirements
- Windows PC
    - The good student will have installed the latest [vvvv beta](https://vvvv.org/downloads), including the addonpack.
    - you will also need the [DX11 pack](https://vvvv.org/contribution/directx11-nodes) and the [Vaudio pack](https://vvvv.org/contribution/vvvv.audio-pack-alpha)
    - The slightly more laid back students will run Install-VVVV.bat from the Scripts folder and everything needed will be installed automagically
    - Also install an ASIO driver if you don't have an ASIO audio interface.
    - I recommand installing [FLStudio trial](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/) with the ASIO driver and then uninstalling FLStudio trial except for the ASIO driver unless of course you want to test out FLStudio. Alternatively you can use [ASIO4ALL](https://www.asio4all.org/)
- 3 button mouse (recommended) - Use space Space + Right Click for middle click if you for some reason don't have a 3 button mouse
- headphones if you want to work with sound
- If you have some data you would like to explore, bring it to the workshop.
