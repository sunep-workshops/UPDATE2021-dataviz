# Data Driven AudioVisuals
## Description
In October 2019 I was diagnosedwith *Acute Lymphatic Leukemia (B-ALL)*. It resulted in a more than 2 year long treatment with daily chemotherapy most of the time. Throughout this period lots of test have been taken currently 655 tests, mainly blood tests.
In Denmark everyone have access to all your own data collected when using the health care system, soon the idea of using this data to drive the narrative of an AV-installation/film was born.
In this workshop we will explore the possibilities in using data do create dynamic audiovisuals. we will use either the blood data or other data that the participants find interesting.
The work will be based on [vvvv-beta](https://vvvv.org/). Prior experience with vvvv will be nice but is not necessary.
## What will you learn?
- How to use data from various data sources to create visuals and sound

- If you have some data you would like to explore, bring it to the workshop.
